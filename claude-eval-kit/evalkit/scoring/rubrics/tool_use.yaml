name: tool_use
criteria: |
  Evaluate whether tool usage was appropriate and accurate.
  If the case expects a specific tool, was it invoked? Were the arguments
  correct? If no tool was expected, did the model avoid unnecessary tool calls?
  Score 5 if tool behavior matches expectations exactly.
  Score 0 if tools were misused, missing, or over-invoked.
scale: "0-5 (0=wrong tool behavior, 5=correct tool behavior)"
